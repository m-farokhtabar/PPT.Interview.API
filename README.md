# Pacific Programming Technical Task

## Developer: Mehdi Farokh Tabar

### 1. How did you verify that everything works correctly?

- **Implemented unit tests** to validate each rule and ensure correct behavior for all edge cases.
- Conducted **manual integration testing** using:
  - **Swagger UI** to validate API endpoints and their functionality.
  - The provided `index.html` file to test end-to-end functionality from UI to backend.
- Performed **automated integration testing** using Postman to simulate various user inputs and confirm proper responses.
- Verified the API's behavior by inputting a variety of identifiers, covering all possible rule scenarios.
- Utilized **console logs** and **network inspection tools** in the browser to validate response data and ensure correct image rendering.

### 2. How long did it take to complete the task?

Approximately **9 hours**, including:
- Setting up the project environment and writing and debugging the backend logic.
- Conducting thorough testing (**unit, manual, and automated**).

### 3. What else could be done to make it production-ready?

To make the solution production-ready, the following improvements could be implemented:

#### Error Handling and Logging
- Implement robust error handling with standardized error response DTOs for consistent client communication.
- Use advanced logging frameworks like **Serilog** with **Elasticsearch** or other sinks to monitor application behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.
- Customize error pages using **StatusCodePagesMiddleware** to deliver user-friendly error information.

#### Performance Optimization
- Introduce distributed caching (e.g., **Redis**) or in-memory caching for frequently accessed database results.
- Optimize database queries to minimize latency, especially when scaling for high user traffic.

#### Security Enhancements
- Secure API with **CORS policies** to allow only trusted domains.
- Implement **rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
- Add authentication and authorization mechanisms if required, using **JWT** or **OAuth2**.

#### Testing Improvements
- Expand **unit tests** to cover repository layers, services, and utilities comprehensively.
- Develop additional **integration tests** to verify seamless interaction between modules.

#### API Enhancements
- Introduce **API versioning** to maintain backward compatibility.
- Enhance Swagger documentation by:
  - Adding XML comments for controllers and models.
  - Using libraries like `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Filters` to include sample requests, responses, and error models for better developer clarity.

#### UX and User Communication
- Localize responses and error messages to support multiple languages where applicable.

#### Scalability and Maintainability
- Introduce **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment.
